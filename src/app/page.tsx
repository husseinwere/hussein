                Back as a Computer Science freshman, I decided to try my hand at freelance, creating websites for any
                small and willing business I could find. I tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
                development. Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of building software for a parastatal, 
                the local government, a start-up, and a huge corporation.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" fontSize='16px'>
                I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet â€” things that look good 
                but are also built well under the hood. In my freetime, I love coding 2D or 3D websites with good design 
                and beautiful animations using WebGL with Three.js and GSAP.
